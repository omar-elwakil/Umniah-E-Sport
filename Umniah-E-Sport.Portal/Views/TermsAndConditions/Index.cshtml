                Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
                Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
                live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
                language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
                supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic
                country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even
                the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
                an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
                text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
                Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were
                thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but
                the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia,
                put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she
                reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
                back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of
                Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
                Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek. Far far away, behind
